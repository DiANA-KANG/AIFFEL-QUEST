# üåº AIFFEL-QUEST

> _**AIFFEL**_ is AI technology course based on national support to encourge employmnet.  
> Through the 6-month-long curriculum, AIFFEL teaches overall general AI skills--including academic theroy and practical experience--, especially focusing on NLP and CV tasks.
>
> Each assignment provided by AIFFEL is called as a "_**QUEST**_", and most of assignments are to practice programming skills with ML & DL algorithms.  
> This repository is to record these assignments, and might be activated during the course which is from Oct. 2023 to Apr. 2024.
